## Available Scripts

### üìÑ `setup-ssh.sh`

- Configures SSH keys and applies a standardized SSH configuration from the repository.
- Downloads and applies your public key to the user's `authorized_keys`.
- Clears existing SSH configuration in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` and applies `50-ssh.conf`.

**Quick execution:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pabumake/boilerplates/main/ubuntu-ssh-config/setup-ssh.sh | bash
```

### üõ†Ô∏è `install-tools.sh`

- Installs essential troubleshooting utilities:
  - `nano` (text editor)
  - `ping` (network troubleshooting)
  - `dnsutils` (`dig` and `nslookup`)
  - `network-manager` (use `nmtui` for network configuration)

- Sets up `NetworkManager` as the primary connection manager.

**Quick execution:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pabumake/boilerplates/main/ubuntu-troubleshooting/install-tools.sh | bash
```

### üê≥ setup-2-node-swarm.sh

Note: It is recommendet to run this before you run the ubuntu-ssh-config, because we require password authentication to setup docker

- Purpose: Sets up a Docker Swarm cluster with two nodes:
- docker0 (Manager) with IP 192.168.1.10
- docker1 (Worker) with IP 192.168.1.11
  
Features:
- Installs Docker and Docker Compose on both nodes.
- Initializes the Swarm on the manager node and joins the worker node to the Swarm.

**Quick execution:**

On the Manager Node (docker0):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pabumake/boilerplates/main/ubuntu-swarm/setup-2-node-swarm.sh | bash -s manager
```

On the Worker Node (docker1):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pabumake/boilerplates/main/ubuntu-swarm/setup-2-node-swarm.sh | bash -s worker
```

Note: 
- Replace your_username with your actual username on both machines.
- Ensure that SSH key-based authentication is set up between the manager and worker nodes for passwordless SSH access.
- After running the scripts, verify the Swarm status on the manager node (docker0) by executing:
```bash
sudo docker node ls
```

### üê≥ setup-basic-swarm-services.sh

Purpose: Deploys Traefik and Portainer services within an existing Docker Swarm cluster.

Features:
- Traefik:
- Deploys Traefik as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- Configures automatic SSL certificate generation using Let‚Äôs Encrypt.
- Secures the Traefik dashboard with basic authentication.
- Portainer:
- Deploys Portainer for Docker management with a user-friendly web interface.
- Integrates Portainer behind Traefik for secure access.

Quick execution:

To execute the script directly from the repository, use the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pabumake/boilerplates/main/ubuntu-swarm/setup-basic-swarm-services.sh | bash
```

This command fetches and executes the script in a single step.  Ôøº

During execution, the script will prompt for the following information:
- Main Domain: The primary domain under which Traefik and Portainer will be accessible (e.g., example.com).
- Email Address: Your email address for Let‚Äôs Encrypt notifications. Ôøº
- Traefik Dashboard Username: Username for accessing the Traefik dashboard.
- Traefik Dashboard Password: Password for the Traefik dashboard.

Post-Execution:
- Access Traefik Dashboard: Navigate to https://traefik.<your_main_domain> and log in using the credentials provided during setup.
- Access Portainer: Navigate to https://portainer.<your_main_domain> to manage your Docker services.

Notes:
- Ensure that DNS records for traefik.<your_main_domain> and portainer.<your_main_domain> point to your server‚Äôs IP address.
- Verify that ports 80 and 443 are open and accessible to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- For detailed configurations and advanced setups, refer to the official documentation of Traefik and Portainer.

‚∏ª

By following the steps above, you can seamlessly deploy and manage Traefik and Portainer within your Docker Swarm environment.
